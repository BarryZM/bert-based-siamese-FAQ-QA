1 How do I delete my Facebook account?
   from here :   Go here: http://www.facebook.com/help/delete_account  Click "Submit" and follow the instructions.  Your account will be deactivated for two weeks, and if you DO NOT USE FACEBOOK IN ANY WAY during that period, your account is permanently deleted.       
2 How do I add new styles to Google docs?
   Right now it's not possible to add more styles or rename the existed ones, but you can modify them to match your needs.  For example you could style your code as you wish and then by selecting one of the headers and choosing the Update Heading # to match selection , that particular style could become your new "Code" style.  Then select something else and apply that heading and you're done.       
3 How do I strikethrough text in Gmail?
   Ok, I have discovered a simple way. Copy this text and paste into your e-mail. Edit the text. Voila!      
4 How do I link a cell in Google Spreadsheets to a cell in another document?
   IMPORTRANGE() appears to be the function you want.  From the Google spreadsheets function list :   Google Spreadsheets lets you reference   another workbook in the spreadsheet   that you're currently editing by using   the ImportRange function. ImportRange   lets you pull one or more cell values   from one spreadsheet into another. To   create your own ImportRange formulas,   enter =importRange(spreadsheet-key,   range). For languages where comma is   used for decimal separation, use a   semicolon instead of a comma to   separate arguments in your formula.  Spreadsheet-key is a STRING which is   the key value from the spreadsheet   URL.  Range is a STRING representing the   range of cells you want to import,   optionally including the sheet name   (defaults to first sheet). You can   also use a range name if you prefer.  Given that the two arguments are   STRINGs, you need to enclose them in   quotes or refer to cells which have   string values in them.  For example:  =importrange("abcd123abcd123", "sheet1!A1:C10") "abcd123abcd123" is   the value in the "key=" attribute on   the URL of the target spreadsheet and   "sheet1!A1:C10" is the range which is   desired to be imported.  =importrange(A1,B1) Cell A1 contains the string ABCD123ABCD123 and cell B1   contains sheet1!A1:C10  Note: In order to use ImportRange, you   need to have been added as a viewer or   collaborator to the spreadsheet from   which ImportRange is pulling the data.   Otherwise, you'll get this error:   "#REF! error: The requested   spreadsheet key, sheet title, or cell   range was not found."   "key" is of course the string in the URL for the spreadsheet that matches to the key= parameter.  I just tested it by creating two spreadsheets. In cell A1 of the first I put a string. In cell A1 of the second I put =importRange("tgR2P4UTz_KT0Lc270Ijb_A","A1") and it displayed the string from the first spreadsheet. (Your key will obviously be different.)  (The format of the function may depend on your locale. In France the formula is not valid with a comma, so you'll need to be replace it with a semi-colon: =importRange("tgR2P4UTz_KT0Lc270Ijb_A";"A1") )  NOTES:   Google currently sets a hard limit of 50 "cross-workbook reference formulas" per spreadsheet. Source: Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides size limits . (h/t JJ Rohrer )  The "new" Google Spreadsheet (soon to be the standard) removes the 50 limit of 50 "cross-workbook reference formulas ( Google Support ) (h/t Jacob Jan Tuinstra )   In the "new" Google Sheets you also use the entire URL as the key ( Google Support ) (h/t Punchlinern )       
5 How can Google Docs and markdown play nice?
   You can give StackEdit a try. It has a nice integration with Google Drive.  Once you import/export a Markdown document from/to Google Drive, you can open it later directly from Google Drive since StackEdit is integrated as a third party editor/viewer application.  You can find StackEdit as a Chrome application as well on the Web Store .  NOTE: I'm the developer of StackEdit.      
6 Gmail &amp; Google Docs: Paste just the text, not the formatting (Firefox, Safari)
   It seems that the browser must enable this feature.  Chrome, PC: Ctrl + Shift + V  Chrome, Mac: Command ⌘ + Shift ⇧ + V  Firefox, PC: Ctrl + Shift + V  Firefox, Mac: Command ⌘ + Shift ⇧ + V  Safari, Mac: Command ⌘ + Shift ⇧ + Option ⌥ + V      
7 How do I download a YouTube video?
   If you're using Firefox as your browser, there are a wealth of addons available for the purpose. Personally I use NetVideoHunter . It suits the way I work. Other options are;   Video DownloadHelper  1-Click YouTube Video Download   There are plenty of others..   For Google Chrome, you could try:   YouTube Downloader - 1.1    Opera has a number of widgets available for the same purpose, but I know nothing about them, like wise Internet Explorer, I haven't used that in years...  Alternatively there is a really useful bookmarklet at Clipnabber .      
8 How can I get code syntax highlighting in Google Docs?
   With the new Add-Ons for Google Drive , you can get code highlighting with the Code Pretty add-on .  After installing the add-on, you can access it by selecting the code you want to format, go to Add-ons → Code Pretty , and select Format Selection :  The result looks like this:      
9 Export Gmail messages to text or HTML files
   The key is configuring your account to be accessible via IMAP.  I've used IMAPSize to backup GMail accounts. To schedule regular backups on a server I use OfflineIMAP .  Although a quick G search reveals tons of tools/scripts/services to do backup of IMAP servers and especially of GMail.      
10 Facebook detects if you are logged in Gmail
   The OAuth tokens for Google are at https://accounts.google.com/b/0/IssuedAuthSubTokens (it's different from Linked Accounts).  When I tried it, Facebook created a popup with a OAuth prompt the first time and only briefly opened a blank popup on subsequent attempts. De-authorizing Facebook makes the prompts appear again.      
11 How can I filter my Gmail messages that aren't labeled?
   Updated: There is a blog today about updated Gmail search modifiers that allow you to do this with a simple search!  has:nouserlabels  Note: Because of Gmails threading you will have labels on some of the messages in the derived list because some messages in a thread will have labeling while some won't. (From Gmail Help - Advanced Search site .)  Original answer:  The Gmail advanced search help page says:   label: Search for messages by label*  There isn't a search operator for unlabeled messages  Example: from:amy label:friends Meaning: Messages from Amy that have the label "friends"  Example: from:david label:my-family Meaning: Messages from David that have the label "My Family"       
12 What happens to your Facebook account when you die?
   You can report this to Facebook requesting that they remove the account or memorialize the account.  From Facebook FAQ:   How do I report a deceased user or an account that needs to be   memorialized and deactivated or   deleted?   Memorializing the account:  Please report this information here so   that we can memorialize this person’s   account. Memorializing the account   restricts profile access to confirmed   friends only. Please note that in   order to protect the privacy of the   deceased user, we cannot provide login   information for the account to anyone.   We do honor requests from close family   members to close the account   completely.  Removing the account:  Immediate family   members may request the removal of a   loved one’s account. This will   completely remove the account from   Facebook so that no one can view it.   We will not restore the account or   provide information on its content   unless required by law. If you are   requesting a removal and are not an   immediate family member of the   deceased, your request will not be   processed, but the account will be   memorialized.  To make a request to memorialize or   remove a profile, please do so here .   If you have a special request   regarding a deceased user's account,   please use this form. Please note that this form is only to be used for   accounts that have already been   memorialized.   The Facebook FAQ page can be found here      
13 How to forward multiple emails in Gmail
   If they're all in a single conversation, then yes: click the Forward All link in the top right when viewing the conversation.  Otherwise, no, you cannot bulk-forward random emails.   In newer versions of Gmail this has moved to the More button under Forward All , and is only visible when you are viewing a conversation of stacked email (stacked by title replies):       
14 Is there a webapp to create ASCII art tables? [closed]
   Now there is: Format Text as Table .  I've been meaning to create this utility for a while. I was actually inspired by MySQL's command line utility and the lack of tables on SO. So thanks for reminding me to make it.  And thanks to @Lipis for the Unicode char idea.  Here's an example of the output:  +------+--------+--------+ |      | ColA   | ColB   | +------+--------+--------+ | Row1 | CellA1 | CellB1 | | Row2 | CellA2 | CellB2 | | Row3 | CellA3 | CellB3 | +------+--------+--------+      
15 Is it possible to export my data from Trello, to back it up?
   With the release of the Data Export feature , you can now   Go to your board  Click the "Board Menu" button (on the right-hand-side of the screen)  Select "Share, Print, and Export"  Click "JSON"   This will download a copy of your board data.  Pro tips:   You can also just add .json (or /somename.json) to the end of a board or card URL, to get the prompt to save the downloaded file  (e.g. https://trello.com/board/welcome-board/4e6a8095efa69909ba007382/somename.json )  Alternatively, instead of clicking on the "JSON" button, you can right-click on it, and copy the URL  If you have lots of boards that you want to download regularly, you'll have to save all the JSON links somewhere for all your boards, and download each one individually.  Changing the names of all these individual files for each set of backups could get a little tedious, so one idea would be to create a new folder each time you backup your boards, and then save a set of exported files into that folder.       
16 How can I import a large list of tasks into Trello
   I wrote a bookmarklet to help with this task.  It's very crude and it works for me today, but I've only tested it briefly and only in Chrome.  It calls some JavaScript functions in Trello directly so it's extremely likely that it will break when they update the site.  Hopefully it works for you, but please don't use it if your data is critical in case it mangles it.  If you want to try it out, you can get the code from here .  There's both a readable version, and a version suitable for copying into a bookmarklet.  To use:   Go here , select the entire contents ("javascript:..." to "...%29%28%29%3B") and copy to the clipboard.  Create a new bookmark, call it something like "Trello - Add Many" and paste the contents from step 1 into the URL field for the bookmark.  Go to the Trello board you want to add items to and click the bookmark.  An overlay should appear that will let you select the list you want to add cards to, and enter a number of new card titles -- one per line.  The overlay will disappear when you hit "Submit".  If you want to get rid of the overlay without adding any new cards then just refresh the page.   Note: If you're trying to get your tasks out of Google Tasks and into Trello then choose Actions - Print task list in Google Tasks, copy the tasks from the printable view, and paste into the bookmarklet's entry box.      
17 How to specify “OR” conditions for Gmail filter
   Type into the search field of Gmail:  from:xyz OR to:uvw  see also here .  to make a filter (and apply actions to that filter) from that search: click the little down arrow on the right side of the search field and then click create filter with this search .      
18 Embed Google Spreadsheet in Google Document
   From today (2016-05-20) on, Google is starting to roll out the ability to embed a chart from a Google spreadsheet into a Google document. At this point, two of my 3 Google accounts make the option available in the Insert menu, with a new Insert→Chart submenu below the Insert→Drawing… item.  When you insert such charts, they remain linked to the original spreadsheet. If all you want is tabular data, there's a table chart type that you can use to present your data as a simple table.  There are some limitations at this stage (e.g. regarding the size of the chart) and the chart must pre-exist in the spreadsheet before you can insert it, but this is going in the right direction…  The chart is not updated live if you modify the source spreadsheet while your document is opened, however, the document will detect changes and offer you to update your chart to reflect the latest changes in the source.      
19 How do I retrieve a message I accidentally archived in Gmail?
   Click on All Mail on the left. When you see the message, open it, and choose the Move to Inbox option to "un-archive" it.  Alternatively, you can use the search feature to locate the message (the search box should be towards the top of the Gmail page).  For more details visit Gmail Help .      
20 How do I split conversations in Gmail?
   Unfortunately it is not possible to split Gmail threads. However, you can mark some messages as "unread from here". When you reply, change the title and reply in a new composing window, so that at least the follow-ups are split.      
21 Is there a way to remove sites permanently from (my personal) Google search results?
   For Chrome users, the official Personal Blocklist Chrome extension can remove sites from your results. Unlike the one referenced in Bernhard Hofmann's answer , this is an official extension developed by Google.  For Firefox users, there is a similar extension called Hide Unwanted Results of Google Search .  Google used to have built-in support for this , but it has removed this feature. If you used this feature, you can still download your block list as a text file .      
22 How do I delete a list or card in Trello?
   Unfortunately, no for lists and boards (for the moment). Card delete has been added since launch. Trello blog gives the answer as follows:   Can I delete a board/list/card and make it go away forever?  Trello doesn't have board or list delete. Archive and close have a   similar effect. Card delete has been added since launch.  To delete a card, first archive it, then click delete from the sidebar   back of the card OR click 'view archive' from the board sidebar, find   the card, and delete it.   I've also found this bug annoying and contacted them.  Edit: Card delete has been added since launch.      
23 Force Google search to use only the exact words typed, no spellcheck or synonyms
   There’s a couple of things you can do to stop Google from being “helpful”:   Add + before the terms that must be included in the result (you can also put them in quotes as you have said)  To make it the default mode (find all terms ), add as_q=all to the URL (this is not as effective as specifically prepending + )   Click the “Showing results for… Search instead for…” link to search for what you typed instead of what Google thinks you meant  To make it the default mode, add &amp;nfpr=1 to the URL    So Googling for one of these should give only pages that have what you are looking for:  http://www.google.com/search?nfpr=1&amp;as_q=all&amp;q=Mayavi+plot3D+vary+tube+radius  http://www.google.com/search?nfpr=1&amp;q=Mayavi+plot3D+%2Bvary+tube+%2Bradius      
24 How can I follow someone on Twitter without them knowing?
   If you use a feed reader such as Google Reader , you can subscribe to the RSS feed of the twitter user you want to "follow". Basically, it'll be like visiting their Twitter page, but you won't show up as a "follower" on Twitter.      
25 How can I backup all of my tweets?
   List of Services   http://www.backupify.com/  http://tweetbackup.com/  http://backupmytweets.com/  http://twistory.net/  https://gimmebar.com/   Saved to Archive   http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/how_to_backup_and_search_all_your_friends_tweets_i.php  http://www.techhit.com/TwInbox/twitter_plugin_outlook.html  http://thinkupapp.com/   Scripts   http://morethanseven.net/2007/11/23/archiving-twitter-data-with-python.html (Python)  http://www.adamfranco.com/2008/10/13/twitter-export-script/ (PHP)  http://blog.jphpsf.com/2012/05/07/backing-up-your-twitter-account-with-t/ (Ruby)   Self Hosted   http://pongsocket.com/tweetnest/   Desktop   https://sourceforge.net/projects/twitter-to-pdf/       
26 Any way to contact a user on Github?
   You can contact a GitHub user by going to her/his user page ( https://github.com/[USERNAME] ) and on the left-hand site you should see her/his email address (if they have provided one).  For example, here's my user page: https://github.com/sobi3ch      
27 In Gmail, how can I attach an attachment from one email to another, without saving the attachment first or forwarding the message?
   The way I do this is to click the Forward option and then type in a new Subject and clear the message text so I have an new message but with the attachments in place.  I'd be surprised if there's a quicker way than this; entering a new Subject doesn't take that long.      
28 Play all YouTube videos uploaded by one user
   URL hacking for the rescue! You can append &amp;list=UL to the end of a video URL from that user.  So, if you have:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zucBfXpCA6s  it should become:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zucBfXpCA6s&amp;list=UL  ^ right here  You could also add something like this to your bookmark and simply click on it:  javascript:window.location+='&amp;list=UL'  Select it then drag and drop it on your bookmarks.  I couldn't figure out how to properly href it here in stackexchange! :(  Now, there is an issue ! It's got a weird behaviour as dear @burtek brought to my attention on the comments. In my instance here, with Valentina Lisitsa, she got 272 videos right now, but it won't ever show more than 99 on the list. And it seems like it's ordered from oldest to newest, so if you want to play all videos you rather start with the user's first video. In her case, this is it:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS_foc_NxI0&amp;list=UL  From there you can leave it playing and it will play all her videos. The current video will always try to be in position #20 of the list, showing 19 previous ones and 79 next ones.      
29 In Google Drive, how can you link directly to “Download” a zip file and not view the contents?
   For the moment, you have to build the URL manually.  https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=YourIndividualID  Where YourIndividualID is the ID of the respective document (zip file). You get it either from the URL or by clicking File → Share and copying it from the sharing URL.  Source .      
30 What is the easiest way to format code when pasting to Gmail?
   Try this online Syntax highlighter:  http://tohtml.com/  It converts your code to HTML and uses inline styling highlight the syntax etc.      
31 Can I host my own instance of Trello?
   No, currently there is no ability to do that and there are no plans to provide something like this either.  Quote from the Common Questions post on the Trello blog:   Can I install this on my own server? No.  I can say with a lot of certainty that we don’t plan on doing   this.  We believe that the majority of people are becoming more   comfortable hosting their services and the boost in dev productivity   we get by only having one platform to test on is immense.       
32 How do I search within someone's tweets?
   Remy Sharp wrote a website application that will search your, or someone else's tweets without the limitations Twitter imposes so you can search far further back in time. It's at http://snapbird.org/ .      
33 How do I share a search query from Google?
   I tried removing all the variables except the q string. It seems to work fine. One thing to note is that Google uses the # symbol, instead of ? which you normally see with query strings.  So, as an example, the URL would be: http://google.com/#q=my+query      
34 Determine who unfriended me on Facebook
   Intentionally, Facebook prevents sending out this info for privacy purposes.  You are free to keep track of your friends though in some other form, and compare it to the current list to find out who is missing each week.  who.removed.me will do this for you automatically      
35 Is it possible to link to a specific portion of a Vimeo video?
   Simply append #t=0m0s to the URL to point 0 minutes and 0 seconds past the start of the video. Replace the 0 with your desired values and the link will scrub forward the specified amount in your browser.   Although this wasn't a feature when I asked the question, Vimeo now supports this across the board.  The forum post with the announcement of this feature and an example of how to link to a moment inside a linked video:  http://vimeo.com/forums/topic:49396  Basically, by appending #t=1m5s you can request the playhead be moved to one minute (1m) and five seconds (5s) of the video, so in the case of my question, the URL would be #t=3m28s :  http://vimeo.com/36881035#t=3m28s      
36 What is Wolfram Alpha good for? [closed]
   It does a lot of things!  I study electronic engineering and it is the coolest web tool :) Something like a web based mathematica  Few examples:  integral sin(x)*sin(x)  inverse laplace transform 1/(s+3)  plane for (1,1,1) (0,0,1) and (1,2,3)  RLC circuit 1ohm, 3nH,1pF  Or roughly analyzing my computer consume: 0.25 €/kwh * 650W * 1 month or you can ask it what will look like the weather tomorrow (it will guess your current location)  Or even funnier (maybe not so useful) things like:  google employees/apple employees  or cheating at the hanging man game: O _ E _ F _ _ _  It's like having a "free" copy of Mathematica at hand, usable even on a netbook or on my N78 :) Don't know why you should use it but it works for me very well!  PS: You should really try to follow links to get the idea.      
37 Link to specific sheet in Google spreadsheet
   When you switch to a different sheet in Google Spreadsheets, pay attention to the URL in your browser's address bar. At the end of the URL you should see something like:  #gid=0  This number changes when you switch sheets, and specifies which sheet to display. Copy the entire URL and create a hyperlink to it with this formula:  =hyperlink("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsaQpHJE_LShcDJ0dWNudHFZWVJqS1dvb3FLWkVrS0E#gid=0", "LINK TEXT")   With a script  I've thought about this question a lot since I first wrote this answer, and I came up with a solution that involves a script.  With the spreadsheet open, click the Tools menu, then Script editor... . Paste all this code into the editor:  function onOpen(event) {   var ss = event.source;   var menuEntries = [];   menuEntries.push({name: "Go to sheet...", functionName: "showGoToSheet"});   ss.addMenu("Tasks", menuEntries); }  function showGoToSheet() {   var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();   var allsheets = ss.getSheets();   var app = UiApp.createApplication();   app.setTitle("Go to sheet...").setWidth(800).setHeight(600);   var table = app.createFlexTable();   table.setCellPadding(5).setCellSpacing(0);   var goToSheetClick = app.createServerHandler('handleGoToSheetClick');   var widgets = [];   for (var i = 0; i &lt; allsheets.length; i++) {     var sheet_name = allsheets[i].getName();     widgets[i] = app.createHTML(sheet_name).setId(sheet_name).addClickHandler(goToSheetClick);     table.setWidget(i, 1, widgets[i])   }   var panel = app.createSimplePanel();   panel.add(table);   app.add(panel);   ss.show(app); }  function handleGoToSheetClick(e) {   var sheet_name = e.parameter.source;   var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();   var sheet = ss.getSheetByName(sheet_name);   sheet.activate();   var app = UiApp.getActiveApplication();   app.close();   return app; }  Save the script, then refresh the spreadsheet. After a second or two a new menu, Tasks , will appear after Help . There is one item in this menu: Go to sheet...   This menu item will open a panel with a list of names of all the sheets in the current spreadsheet. It doesn't look like it, but if you click on one of the sheet names, that sheet will come to the front.   As an answer to another question, this script was improved to include a scrollable view and buttons.      
38 How can I search for Gmail messages on a particular date?
   You can use the before and after keywords in your search, for example:  after:2012/4/26 before:2012/5/3  To search for emails between April 26, 2012 and May 3, 2012.      
39 Linking directly to a specific point in time of a YouTube video
   Simply add #t=XmYs to the end of the URL where X is the number of minutes and Y is the number of seconds.  i.e. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxxxxxxxxxxx#t=2m0s for your example.      
40 How to view the parent folder of a Google Document?
   A document can potentially be in multiple folders, but you can get a list of them through the UI.   First, click the folder icon next to the document title:  This will open a list of the folders that the current document is in:   You can click the folder name from that list to go to the main Drive listing for that folder, or click the Organize button to move the document to another folder.       
41 Is there any way to see traffic sources to a Github project?
   It's now a baked in feature under the GitHub Traffic section .   You can now see detailed analytics data for repositories that you're an owner of or that you can push to. Just load up the graphs page for your particular repository and you'll see a new link to the traffic page.   The old method used to be some hack like adding an image or similar web bug to your README file.  When someone comes across your repo, provided your README has an extension that GitHub will automatically render , then it should also load the image. And that should, depending on how the web bug is set up, give you some detail or clue as to the source of traffic.  Or you could appeal via contact to the GitHub Supportocats and see if they're willing to give you a heads up on the incoming source of the sauce.      
42 Search in Gmail - How to search the mails without reply?
   I don't know of a direct way to do this, but you can create a filter that marks any mail containing " Re: " with a specific label (lets say RE ), and the search for -{label:RE}  alternatively, skip the labeling part and search for -{"re:"}      
43 How can I only search the Primary inbox in Gmail?
   Doesn't look like the "category" filter knows how to filter to the "Primary" inbox, but you can do it by excluding the other categories like so:  in:inbox -category:(updates OR promotions OR social OR forums)  Or, to show just unread messages in the "Primary" inbox:  in:inbox -category:(updates OR promotions OR social OR forums) is:unread      
44 How can I subscribe to a Google mailing list with a non-Google e-mail address?
   Yes, just click in Join this group and choose your preferences. Then you're set  Edit: I'm sorry I've misread your question.  You could try this trick, paste in your browser URL bar:   http://groups.google.com/group/mojolicious/boxsubscribe?email=myid   Replace 'mojolicious' with the name of the group you want to join, and replace myid with the email address you want to use. You should get a confirmation email (I've just tried it and it works with hotmail)      
45 In Google Drive, is there a way to search files located in a particular folder?
   As of the date of this post, Google Drive does not support searching within a specific folder. However, the new Docs, Sheets, and Slides home screens do have a way to let you do this via the File Picker search interface:   Go to: https://docs.google.com  Click the File Picker folder icon on the right side of screen.  Navigate to the specific folder that you want to search.  Now put your query term in the file picker's search box and hit 'Enter' (Or click the 'Search for all items containing ')   Your search results will only come from the folder you selected.  Note: you can still filter by file type in the File Picker search bar by clicking the drop down arrow.      
46 How to set up Gmail to show more than 20 results per page when searching?
   CrystalFire hacked a way out!!  He found out this awesome url hacking which Joe made into a bookmarklet .  Please, go ahead and do upvote their answers. I hope either one gets accepted. ^_^   My previous answer, with some updated terms:  Just to be clear, as moose already said :  No , there's still no way to do that nativelly . So, please, still go ahead and bother Google Team :  In the past, we could go and suggest it as a feature . But right now, best way to do it is going on the Settings Wheel -&gt; Help -&gt; Send Feedback   Do every kind of feedback, and maybe one day we'll have it... After all, who knows until when this hack will work! Maybe this hack is their initial attempt to implement it at last.      
47 How can I back up all emails stored in my Gmail account?
   The most simple way to do this is activating pop3 or IMAP in your "Mail Settings" and retrieving the email using your own client (Thunderbird, Outlook, etc.).      
48 How can I send a fax online? [closed]
   I've been really happy with efax.com . It's not free, but fairly cheep. It can handle PDF and other file types and works great. I believe you can also receive faxes as well, but have never needed that.      
49 YouTube stops buffering when video is paused
   It seems to be on a video by video basis. Your 'create a spaceship' tutorial will buffer when paused, but your 'create a city' tutorial will not.  They seem to use slightly different players; based on the right-click menus.  The spaceship tutorial mentions HTML5 and the city tutorial has the standard Flash menu.  You could try forcing the use of a different media player or you could try joining Youtube's HTML5 trial; the 'create a city' tutorial buffers fine when played using the HTML5 player.  https://www.youtube.com/html5  Edit to include solution by Andrew Price:   Login in to your YouTube account  In 'Settings' go to the 'Playback' menu  Under 'Video Playback Quality' check the 'I have a slow connection' option   This will default video output to 360p, but you can manually alter this when playing the video.  Even at higher definitions the video will continue to buffer.      
50 How do I delete all my mail from my Gmail account?
   Go to your All mail view ,  and click "Select all" (or the drop down option All from the checkbox far left of Archive | Spam | Delete buttons).  Underneath the | Archive | Spam | Delete | + | - | Move to Inbox | Labels | More | buttons...  You'll see a message appear in a yellow bar that says:   All 100 conversations on this page are selected. Select all 73795 conversations in All Mail   Click on the "Select all conversations" link on the right side of the message, then click delete.  The actual deletion process may take a very, very long time, during which you will be unable to use Gmail or log in (don't worry, it's still churning away in the background, even if it gives you an error!)  When it's done, all conversations (except spam) will be in the trash and you should see a message that says "You don't have any mail! Our servers are feeling unloved."  Now just empty the trash and delete all spam, and your account is now empty.      
51 How can I send a Windows executable via Gmail?
   Rename your file to something like example.exe_ and try again.      
52 How can I read all answers on Quora without having to register?
   Just add the get parameter ?share=1 at the end of the question's URL, and all the answers will show. It seems you have to set it only once per browser session.  I was so annoyed by this, I have even built an Chrome extension for this. ( It's also open source. )      
53 How do you handle dependencies between cards with Trello?
   Trello does not have an official way to handle dependencies. The best thing to do is to have a "Waiting" list where you keep all the cards that are waiting on some other piece of work. If this becomes unmanageable, it's probably a sign that the board needs to be split up.      
54 How does Gmail decide to thread email messages?
   The following conditions must be met:   The subject must be similar (e.g. test and re: test will work; but test and test 123 won't).  The sender must be a part of the thread OR the in-reply-to header must be used.   The in-reply-to header can be used via Gmail's interface by simply replying to the thread. This is what enables forwarded messages to be a part of the same thread even though the sender is different.  If you want more information, you can check out my blog post where I posted more detailed information about my findings.      
55 How can I mark a card in Trello as done and keep it in the original list?
   Trello doesn't have a predefined way to mark a card as done, but you could certainly name a label "Done" and apply it to cards that you have completed.      
56 Get e-mail addresses from Gmail messages received
   I am quite surprised of all the complicated answers implying some extra tools! Every email you receive has its address added to "All contacts" (as opposed to "My Contacts") in the Contacts part of Gmail. Export that one and you're done (or I missed something in your question).      
57 How can I set a Gmail filter that finds email sent “only to me”?
   To search for email sent only to you and not to a mailing list, for example, you have to add the following to the search box (and then you can create a filter using that search; there is a link in the expanded search box that says "Create filter &gt;&gt;" or something):  To:me AND -*  This means it'll search for email sent to "me" (that's you) and not to everybody else (including you) (that's * ), but the first part (i.e., To:me ) overrides that.      
58 Are there any important features from Microsoft Office that a college student would miss if he switched entirely over to Google Docs? [closed]
   Well...   Conversion : Students love to format their Documents (margins,borders,cover pages, advanced numbering, page breaks, section breaks) to their liking, it sucks if you are in group project and everyone else is using Word. It would be sad also if the professor sent you an assignment in .doc or .docx format and you lost information on the transfer.  Animations/Transitions in Presentations Maybe I am wrong/outdated but I have not seen that in Google Docs  Goal Seek : This is a life saver in Excel. If you are not packing Matlab or Mathematica then this is your saviour with non-linear equations   Other small features depend on what field and what courses but I assure you when you reach the upper levels even formatting stuff on Office for Mac is frowned upon. Do not even try googling for X vs Y it would not work, it is stuffed with tons of bloggers who do not even know how to make reset the line numbering by breaks :S . Also most likely your school would be in the MSDN Alliance which make Office software available in labs and classrooms.      
59 Am I allowed to host a commerical website on Github Pages?
   According to the GitHub Terms of Service , under section G.

Of course we hope folks will Keep It Classy™ and use this power for awesome! Thanks       
60 Create a Google maps link to a specific location
   It's very straightforward. Just use the following link, changing the latitude and longitude for yours. The z is the zoom index, you can play with it to get where you want.  http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;ll=35.028028,-106.536655&amp;z=13  I got this information by clicking on the "Link" button in the right hand corner above a map. This will also allow you to get the latitude and longitude for a location.  I don't know of a good way to make a marker on Google Maps, through the UI anyway.  Right click on a point and select "What's Here?" to create a marker, but it will be to the closest thing (business, intersection, address, etc). This essentially performs a search with the latitude and longitude and returns whatever is closest to your search. A URL to do that would be:  http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.128061,-106.535561&amp;ll=35.126517,-106.535131&amp;z=17  With the q (for query I believe) being the coordinates where you want your marker.  A more effective method, if you are trying to send a link to a specific address would be to search for the address in Google Maps, which will give you a marker on the exact address and then use the "Link" button to get the URL for sharing.      
61 How can I make some data on a Google Spreadsheet auto-sorting?
   You can use the sort() function for that, but you have to have your data in one place, and an automatically sorted copy of that data in another place.  For example, say I have Sheet1 with my data:  | A    | B    | C =====================  1 | This | this | 2  2 | Is   | is   | 1  3 | Test | test | 3  Then in Sheet2, cell A1, I would put this function:   =sort(Sheet1!A:C, 3, TRUE)   This would show my data, but sorted by column C (the third column), ascending.  | A    | B    | C =====================  1 | Is   | is   | 1  2 | This | this | 2  3 | Test | test | 3      
62 How can I find out when I subscribed to a YouTube channel?
   Kind of a long way to do it but it was the only way I can find. I wanted to find out when I subscribed to someone, so to it I went to my YouTube channel and the first thing you see when you get there is your activity on YouTube. I knew the person I was searching for I was subscribed to for about a year so what I had to do was keep scrolling down until I found when I originally subscribed. As far as I saw it won't be an exact date so in my case it said a year, it could be anywhere from a year up to a year and 11 months. You still get an estimate of when you subscribed. Sorry for the long and vague answer, but it was all I could think of.      
63 Multiple dropbox accounts on one PC?
   Dropbox supports sharing content across multiple accounts.   On the Dropbox website, using the account you wish to share from, create a new folder (e.g. "my project")  In the top toolbar, select "Invite to folder", enter the email addresses for the recipients (make sure it's the email they already use for their Dropbox account).  Each recipient will get an email asking if they wish to accept the share. When they do, the new folder (e.g. "my project") will appear and synch in their personal account.  The recipient can reorganise as they see fit.  just move the location of the folder in their account (say to move it into a "shared" folder or a "Projects for Matt" folder) - it won't affect anyone else who is sharing it (only changes to the contents of the folder will)       
64 How do I ensure that what I post on Facebook stays private?
   Honestly, if you are really concerned with privacy of your account it may be better to not post anything you would not want to be public.      
65 Display mail size in Gmail
   Gmail now supports searching by size: http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=7190  The new operators are:   size: — Search for messages larger than the specified size in bytes  Example: size:1000000   Meaning: All messages larger than 1MB (1,000,000 bytes) in size.   larger: and smaller: — Similar to size: but allows abbreviations for numbers  Example: larger:10M  Meaning: All messages of at least 10M bytes (10,000,000 bytes) in size.    You can now search for emails of that size and delete any to free up space.      
66 Multi user filter issue in Google Spreadsheets
   Now Google Drive has a feature called “filter views”. It makes some filters available only to you while you don't change any data.   Use filter views in the new Google Sheets  In Google Sheets, filtering your data makes it easier for you to view and analyse data by letting you hide data that you want to temporarily take out of view. The new Google Sheets introduces filter views as well, which allow you to create, name, and save filters that you can use without disrupting how others are viewing your spreadsheet.  Creating a filter view  When you create a filter view, it’s like saving a filter that you can use over and over again.   Open the spreadsheet where you would like to create a filter view.  Click the Data menu, hover over “Filter views…” and select Create a new filter view. You can also click the down arrow to the right of the filter  icon and select Create a new filter view.  Using the down arrows in the column headers, sort and filter the data to fit your desired view. Your filter view will be saved as you make changes.  To close your new filter view, either click the X in the top-right corner of the spreadsheet or click the down arrow to the right of the filter  icon and select None.     (Note: If you had existing shared filter on columns first remove that.)  Source .      
67 Adding bibliographic references to a Google Docs document?
   Google Docs now has built-in citation, using the research tool.   The Research tool makes it easy to add information from the web to your documents and presentations. To access the tool:   Select the Research option from the Tools menu.  Use the keyboard shortcut ( Ctrl + Cmd + I on Mac, Ctrl + Alt + Shift + I on PC ).  Right-click on a specific word and select Research.    Choose scholar in the search bar; search for your citation, and click on "Cite as Footnote".  Source .  EDIT  I have been made aware of a third-party add-on that provides more extensive citation functionality to Google Docs called Paperpile .  It provides many different inline and footnoted citation styles (They claim &gt;7000).  Also, Faculty of 1000 Workspace ( http://f1000.com/work/ ; geared at life sciences) has a google docs extension ( http://f1000.com/work/faq/google-docs-add-on )      
68 Reverse image search engine [closed]
   You want to use tineye :  TinEye is a reverse image search engine. It finds out where an image came from, how it is being used, if modified versions of the image exist, or if there is a higher resolution version.      
69 How to analyze size of files in Dropbox
   In the web interface click repeatedly the second column header, i.e. Type until it shows Size - then you will see the size of all the items in the current folder.      
70 Add subtitles to a video of another user on YouTube
   Currently you cannot add a subtitle/caption track to someone else's video.  However, you can prepare the caption/subtitle file for the video and then share it the author so they can add it to the video (it's simple and I don't think he or she would object since subtitles do not have to be turned on by default).  Since it will be in another language as the video's audio track (and not in English either) you will have to prepare a time-coded subtitle script (or caption file ). There are a number of articles about that available online including a good one to start with on Youtube help site.  Overall guidelines on preparing and adding subtitles to Youtube are available here .      
71 Send urgent mail in Gmail
   Interesting.  I tested by sending an email to my Gmail acct from an Exchange account, and setting the flag urgent.  Then I looked at the email in the web interface and from Outlook. In Outlook (getting Gmail) I saw the message flagged urgent. In the Web interface, I saw no urgent indication.  I replied to the message from the web interface and from Outlook. In the web interface, the urgent flag was not shown, and did not make it back to the Exchange account. In Outlook, the reply did not have the urgent flag activated, but when I activated it it was visible back on the Exchange account.  So, to summarize .. the Gmail web interface does not recognize the urgent flag, at least not as implemented by Microsoft Exchange. But the Gmail engine does not lose the header data when it is provided by another client.  As an aside .. I find the urgent flag far more irritation than it is worth.  Rarely does "urgent" to you mean that it should be "urgent" to me. When is the last time that you received a message flagged "low priority"?  IMHO it is far better to indicate in the subject and body that the issue is urgent or time-sensitive.  EDIT: Google just added (1-Sept-2010) the "Priority Inbox" functionality and some kind of importance measure. I will redo my tests and update.      
72 Can I see only mail I have archived in Gmail?
   Inbox is a label.  Search for -label:inbox      
73 Is there a way to get email notifications when someone tweets?
   ifttt has a trigger in the Twitter channel, called "New tweet by specific user", that seems to be exactly what you're looking for.      
74 How can I import Facebook events into my Google calendar?
   You can get an iCal link for your Upcoming Events (or Birthdays) that you can import into Google Calendar which will automatically stay up to date.  In Facebook:   Go to your Events  Go to the lower right portion of the page, where you'll see a message with two links:  Save the URL for the "Upcoming Events" link. (This will vary by browser/OS, but is generally something like right-click and "Copy link address")   The URL should be similar to:  webcal://www.facebook.com/ical/u.php?uid=999999999&amp;key=AbCDEf12345AAcd-f  (Your actual uid and key values will be different, of course.)  In Google Calendar:   Scroll down and open the "Other calendars" menu (on the left)  Choose "Add by URL"  Paste the webcal URL in the "URL" space then "Add Calendar"   You should now have a calendar "{Your Name}'s Facebook Events" listed under "Other Calendars" and can change the color, details, etc. as needed.  See also: Facebook Help      
75 How to remove Dropbox access from a computer you no longer have?
   Whilst it is possible to unlink other computers through the web interface, as slhck noted, this leaves all of your files where you don't want them. Depending on the sensitivity of your files (and how much work you want for yourself) you can:   Back up all Dropbox files locally  Delete any sensitive files from your Dropbox  Wait for the sync to remove these files from the remote computer  Unlink the offending computer(s) from https://www.dropbox.com/account#security  Return the backed-up files to your Dropbox for re-syncing   It might be worth leaving any other synced computers off (or disabling their syncs) during this process to avoid the sync deleting/restoring where unnecessary.      
76 Is there a way to create a link to a particular position inside a Google Doc?
   Create a bookmark (insert -&gt; bookmark). Then you can add #name_of_bookmark to the end of the url.  eg:  http://docs.google.com/document/d/15xm3Bx4Elnjbg0VNY#name_of_bookmark      
77 In Gmail, can I base my “send from” address on a filter?
   Yes  In your Gmail settings, under "Accounts and Import", if you have multiple "send mail as" accounts set up you can choose to always default to your Gmail account or to respond with the account to which the message was sent.       
78 Is there a way to join Google Hangouts without a Google+ account?
   I'm not sure if this is a feature that has been introduced in the year since the question was asked, but it appears that you can use a limited version without a Google+ account via Gmail chat according to this support article :   If you don’t have a Google+ account you can start or join a limited hangout, which only includes the option to hang out with 1 other person. If you’d like access to all Hangouts’ features including the ability to hang out with up to 9 people, share your screen, and use cool Hangouts’ apps, you can upgrade to a free Google+ account   This sounds similar to what Korey has encountered and what Freedom tried to suggest.  This answer presumes you have GMail/Google account, but not a Google+ one. Unfortunately Google seem to be closing off their systems, highlighted by the discontinuation of XMPP support .      
79 Where do my emails go when I click on 'Archive' in Gmail?
   In the left pane there should be an "All Mail" option. If there isn't, expand the down arrow that should say something like "6 more" (see screenshot below), and click All Mail. Select them and you can move them back to the inbox if desired.       
80 In Gmail, how can I find the oldest message from a person?
   If you click "1-20 of [...]" you will see options to jump to the Newest or Oldest. The Oldest option isn't available if Gmail is still calculating the results so you may need to wait until the query finishes processing. Wait some time and hit the Older button to update the menu.      
81 How to hide my likes from my friends on Facebook?
   The privacy of your like is dependent on the privacy of your friend's post. if they only share the post with you, then you liking it will only appear in your friend's activity feed/newsfeed.  If they share it with a group of friends it will appear only in that group of friends' activity feed/newsfeed.  If they share it publicly. It will end up in all your friend's activity feed/news feed      
82 How can I access google.com outside the US?
   Try http://www.google.com/ncr  This is only one of several ways to do this according to Google :    Click the Google.com link on any other domain.  Choose a Google domain manually by visiting the Language Tools page (the section with the flags).  Bookmark http://www.google.com/ncr . This is an alternative web address for Google.com that always takes you to Google.com without redirecting you.        
83 How do I disable autoplay on YouTube?
   Google Chrome:  For users of Google Chrome, you can use the extension Stop Autoplay for YouTube. This extension will automatically turn off, disable and disable auto-play feature on YouTube, however this extension will not disable buffering.      
84 What can you NOT find on Google? [closed]
   A few ideas on the type of things:   Content explicitly disallowed by a domain's robots.txt file is excluded from the Google index.  Websites that are not linked from other websites that Google already knows. That is, there are probably a lot of websites that do not get linked from visible pages, those websites are never going to be found by the Google spider unless they're manually submitted to Google via the Webmaster Tools .  Websites that are behind web forms that you need to fill out.  Census images. Since the content are images that are often manually index, they usually found on paid-for sites like ancestry.com.   Learn more about the Deep Web      
85 How do I untrust a computer with Google two-factor authentication?
   Clear the browser's cookies (and perhaps cache/history).   'Trust this computer' option doesn’t work  For computers you trust, Google recommends you select the "Trust this computer" option when you are asked for a verification code. When you check this box, you won’t have to enter a code every time you sign in to your account from that computer.  This feature uses a cookie to remember your browser when you sign in. If you’re still being asked to enter a code despite selecting the “Trust this computer” option, this might be because your browser is set to delete cookies after a certain period of time, or is set to delete cookies every time you quit the browser. You may also be manually clearing cookies from your browser. (emphasis added)       
86 How do I delete entries from my GitHub Activity Feed?

87 Can I browse all the public Trello boards available?
   There is not currently a way to browse all public boards.      
88 Is it possible to stop people from associating things with me on Facebook without my permission?
   You can achieve this by going to your Privacy Settings .   Select Edit Settings under "How Tags Work"    Click Off next to Timeline Review    Review the information about Timeline Review and select Enabled from the dropdown.        
89 Self-Hosted alternative to Google Docs? [closed]
   You can use FengOffice , however, I don't think it has the ability to upload/download as office formats.  There is EtherPad , which google docs docs is based off of, but it only has word documents, and I don't think it has upload/download either.

99 How does the Facebook friend finder operate?
   Facebook has access to all friendship-data on their site, even if you lock down the privacy settings. As an addition many users share their contact-book or even e-mails with Facebook. Most peoples have filled out their profile quite decent so it has data about your school, your employer, your current place, your interests and so on. Although Facebook states it does not use it, they can track all users (and even non-users) across many websites via the "like"-button which is transcluded directly from Facebook.  From this data it can calculate this friend requests.

105 How can I export my Google chat logs?
   The IMAP interface to Gmail now provides access to chat messages . If you had already set up Gmail IMAP, then you only have to enable the IMAP visibility for the "Chat" label in the Gmail settings (in the "Label" tab, a "show in IMAP" tick box is available for each label).  Update : this method works for Google Chat, but NOT for Hangouts, only conversations of the type Google Chat are exposed via IMAP, roughly all conversations until Spring/Summer 2013, depending on when one has enabled Google Hangouts.

111 How does Facebook guess results when you search for someone?
   I don't know for certain (I don't work for Facebook!), but from my experience it seems to bring back results in (approximately) the following order:   From your friends  From your friends friends  People with common interests (liked pages, shared groups etc.)   After this it starts to become more guesswork, but I suspect that home town, shared work places etc all come into play as well.  With more than 500 million users there's a lot of data and existing connections they can use to base their heuristics on

113 How to disable auto-save in Google Docs?
   I agree with the previous answer in that you can not disable the auto-save but there are a couple easy workarounds that will allow you to work on your document while at the office.  After you login to Google Docs and are looking at your list of documents, hover your mouse over the document in question. You should see an 'Actions' dropdown appear to the right. If you click on that you should be given the option to 'download' the file.  Now you can work on your document locally on your office computer and when you are done for the day just upload it back to Google Docs.   :)      
114 How can I recursively set ownership of Google Drive files and folders?
   I created a command-line tool to handle this.  After following the setup instructions on the GitHub project, you can run the tool with a specified path prefix and the email address of the new owner:  python transfer.py PATH-PREFIX NEW-OWNER-EMAIL  After getting authorization from OAuth, it will recursively walk the Google Drive account it got authorization to, match against the path prefix (ignoring non-matches), and then transfer ownership to the new email. If the new email address indicates a user who isn't even shared on the item yet, it will handle that as well. The current owner will not lose access, but the new or old owner can revoke it.  I should note that it's not always possible to transfer ownership of an item in Drive. For example, it's not possible to move ownership for an item from G Suite (Google Apps for Work) account to a normal GMail account. It can be shared (which the script will do), but ownership transfer will fail.

118 How do I add a caption to an image in Google Documents?
   As of October 25, 2013, Google Documents does not support text wrapping around tables, so inserting a table and putting an image and a caption in it will work but cannot be made to have text wrapped around it.  One workaround is that since text can wrap around images, we can choose Insert &gt; Drawing... and create a drawing with the text we want to caption the image with.  The resulting drawing can be changed to have text wrapped around it, and can then be placed beneath the image we inserted.

123 Can I trust dropbox and similar services? [closed]
   If your files are of a very sensitive nature then you should already be taking measures to secure them regardless of any promises or the good reputation of the service.  If however these files are of 'normal' sensitivity then the risk of bad press will usually be enough to guarantee they're good behaviour, after all your files are probably worth less to them than your (even potential) subscription fees.
